### Basics of NestJS: Controllers

#### What are Controllers in NestJS?

Controllers in NestJS are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and sending responses back to the client. They're the point of interaction between the client and the backend services of your application.

A controller is merely a class decorated with `@Controller()` and often associates with a specific route path. Inside a controller, we define methods to handle different types of HTTP actions (like GET, POST, PUT, etc.).

#### Creating a Controller:

1. **Using the NestJS CLI to Generate a Controller**:

For our `Cats` module, let's create a controller named `Cats`.

```bash
nest generate controller cats
```

Or, for short:

```bash
nest g co cats
```

This command will create a `cats.controller.ts` file inside the `cats` directory.

2. **Review the Generated Controller**:

By default, the generated `cats.controller.ts` will look like this:

```typescript
import { Controller } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {}
```

The `@Controller('cats')` decorator indicates that this controller will handle routes that start with `/cats`.

3. **Defining Route Handlers**:

Inside the controller, you can create methods to handle various HTTP actions. For this example, we'll start with a simple GET request:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  
  @Get()
  findAll(): string {
    return 'This action returns all cats!';
  }
}
```

With the above code, when someone sends a GET request to `/cats`, the `findAll()` method will be invoked, and it'll return the string `'This action returns all cats!'`.

#### Other Important Aspects of Controllers:

- **Route Parameters**: You can capture segments of the URL using route parameters:

    ```typescript
    @Get(':id')
    findOne(@Param('id') id: string): string {
      return `This action returns the cat with ID ${id}`;
    }
    ```

  In this case, a GET request to `/cats/123` will return `This action returns the cat with ID 123`.

- **Request Payload**: For methods that send data (like POST or PUT), you can retrieve the payload using decorators like `@Body()`:

    ```typescript
    @Post()
    create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
      // your logic here
    }
    ```

  `CreateCatDto` would be a class that defines the data structure you expect to receive. This structure aids in validating the incoming data and is useful for TypeScript type checking.

- **Response Status**: NestJS allows you to set HTTP response statuses using decorators like `@HttpCode()`:

    ```typescript
    @Post()
    @HttpCode(204)
    create() {
      // your logic here
    }
    ```

#### Testing the Controller:

Now that we have a basic controller set up, you can run the app using:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Once the application is running, you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000/cats` in your browser or use a tool like Postman to see the result from our `findAll()` method.

Now you're familiar with the basics of creating and using controllers in NestJS. As we move forward, we'll get into more intricate details, but for now, this provides a solid starting point.
