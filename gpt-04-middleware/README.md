### Basics of NestJS: Middleware

#### What is Middleware in NestJS?

Middleware in NestJS provides a way to handle requests and responses, acting as a bridge between the request and the actual route handlers (usually controllers). 
It's essentially a function with access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware in line (`next`).

Middleware can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as:

- Logging incoming requests
- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation
- Setting headers or modifying the response in some manner
- Handling CORS
- And much more!

#### Creating Middleware:

Unlike controllers and providers, middleware in NestJS doesn't have a dedicated decorator. Instead, middleware is just a class that implements the `NestMiddleware` interface. This interface forces the middleware to implement a `use()` method.

Let's create a basic logging middleware:

1. **Creating the Middleware Class**:

Make a new file named `logger.middleware.ts` in your `cats` directory and insert the following:

```typescript
import { Injectable, NestMiddleware } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';

@Injectable()
export class LoggerMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
  use(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    console.log('Request method:', req.method);
    console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
    next();
  }
}
```

This middleware logs the request method and URL every time a request is received.

2. **Applying Middleware**:

To use this middleware, you have to configure it in a module using the `configure` method of the module.

Open `cats.module.ts` and modify it to use our `LoggerMiddleware`:

```typescript
import { Module, NestModule, MiddlewareConsumer } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';
import { LoggerMiddleware } from './logger.middleware';

@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
})
export class CatsModule implements NestModule {
  configure(consumer: MiddlewareConsumer) {
    consumer
      .apply(LoggerMiddleware)
      .forRoutes(CatsController);
  }
}
```

With this configuration, every time a request is made to any endpoint related to `CatsController`, our `LoggerMiddleware` will be executed.

3. **Middleware Functional Approach**:

NestJS also supports a functional middleware approach instead of a class. Here's how our `LoggerMiddleware` could be written as a function:

```typescript
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';

export function logger(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  console.log('Request method:', req.method);
  console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
  next();
}
```

To use this, replace `.apply(LoggerMiddleware)` with `.apply(logger)` in your module configuration.

#### Order of Middleware Execution:

Middleware execution order is crucial. If you have multiple middlewares and their order matters (e.g., an authentication middleware should run before any data processing middleware), ensure you apply them in the correct order.

Middleware offers a flexible mechanism for request processing and can be pivotal for tasks like authentication, logging, CORS handling, and more. Mastering middleware is crucial for developing efficient NestJS applications.
