### Deep Dive into Guards:

#### What are Guards in NestJS?

In the context of NestJS, a Guard is a class annotated with the `@Injectable()` decorator. It implements the `CanActivate` interface. The primary responsibility of a Guard is to determine if a request should proceed.

Common use-cases for guards include:
- Authentication (e.g., verifying if a user is logged in)
- Authorization (e.g., verifying if a user has the correct permissions to perform an action)

#### Creating a Guard:

Let's create a basic guard that checks for an "auth" token in the request headers. If it exists, the request will proceed. If it doesn't, the request will be denied.

1. **Using the NestJS CLI to Generate a Guard**:

```bash
nest g guard auth
```

This command will create an `auth.guard.ts` file.

2. **Implement the Guard**:

Open the generated `auth.guard.ts` and modify it:

```typescript
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(
    context: ExecutionContext,
  ): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const hasAuthToken = request.headers['auth'];

    // Basic check if the auth token is present in the request headers
    return !!hasAuthToken;
  }
}
```

This is a basic check. In a real-world scenario, you'd likely be verifying the token's validity, its contents, or checking it against a database or other backend service.

3. **Applying the Guard to a Route**:

To protect a route using the guard, you can bind it directly to a route's handler method using the `@UseGuards()` decorator.

Let's assume you have a method in your `CatsController` that you want to protect:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard } from './auth.guard';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  
  @Get('protected')
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard)
  findProtectedCats() {
    return "This route is protected!";
  }
}
```

Now, if you try to access the `/cats/protected` route without providing an "auth" header, you'll be denied access.

### Middleware vs. Guards:

#### 1. **Purpose and Philosophy**:
- **Middleware**: These are low-level, general-purpose pieces of code that deal with the request and response objects directly. They are typically used for tasks like logging, CORS, body parsing, and any operations that should happen on every request, or a wide range of requests, regardless of which route will handle it. Middleware doesn't "think" in terms of routes, controllers, or the specifics of your application logic.

- **Guards**: These are higher-level constructs tied directly to your application's business logic. They are more about implementing your application's rules, especially around authorization. They "think" in terms of routes, methods, and controllers. Guards have built-in utilities that make decision-making based on route metadata, user roles, and other specifics more straightforward.

#### 2. **Access to the Application's Context**:
- **Middleware**: They don't have direct access to Nest's execution context. They primarily deal with the raw `req` and `res` objects from Express (or Fastify, if you're using it).

- **Guards**: They have access to the full execution context, meaning they can pull metadata from the route, the class, or method decorators. This context-awareness makes guards particularly suitable for role-based access control and other route-specific logic.

#### 3. **Return Values and Flow Control**:
- **Middleware**: Can't directly send a response to the client unless you directly call a method on the `res` object, which you might want to avoid in NestJS to keep things framework-agnostic. Middleware calls the `next()` function to pass control to the next middleware in line (or the route handler if there's no more middleware).

- **Guards**: Have a clear way of dictating whether a request proceeds or not by returning `true` or `false` from their `canActivate` method. They can also throw exceptions using Nest's exception filters.

#### 4. **Order of Execution**:
- **Middleware**: Always executed before guards.

- **Guards**: Executed after all middlewares have been processed and just before the route handler is called.

### When to Use Which?

- Use **Middleware** for:
    - General tasks applicable to multiple routes (e.g., logging, CORS handling).
    - Global input validation or transformation.
    - Setting up some global state or context for later use in the request lifecycle.

- Use **Guards** for:
    - Role-based access control.
    - Validating the identity of a user.
    - Any decision-making that requires context about which specific route or controller method is being accessed.

In summary, while there's an overlap, the distinction is mainly about the level of abstraction and the intended use-case. Middleware is more about the "plumbing" and general request/response handling, while guards are more about business rules and application-specific logic.

### 1. **Applying a Guard to an Entire Controller**:

You can use the `@UseGuards()` decorator at the controller class level to apply a guard to every route handler within that controller.

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard } from './auth.guard';

@UseGuards(AuthGuard)
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  
  @Get('protected1')
  findProtectedCats1() {
    return "This route is protected!";
  }

  @Get('protected2')
  findProtectedCats2() {
    return "This route is also protected!";
  }
}
```

In the example above, both `findProtectedCats1` and `findProtectedCats2` are protected by the `AuthGuard` because the guard is applied to the entire `CatsController`.

### 2. **Applying a Guard Globally**:

If you want to use a guard across multiple controllers or globally across the entire application, you can set it up at the module level.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { APP_GUARD } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AuthGuard } from './auth.guard';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';

@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_GUARD,
      useClass: AuthGuard,
    },
  ],
})
export class CatsModule {}
```

By using the `APP_GUARD` token, you're telling NestJS to use `AuthGuard` as a global guard. Now every route in your application will pass through this guard unless you specifically exclude it or override it with another guard.

### Important Consideration:

When applying guards globally or across multiple routes, ensure that the guard's logic is appropriate for wide application. For example, if a guard checks for user authentication, applying it globally means every route will require authentication unless otherwise specified.

### 3. **Excluding Routes**:

If you apply a guard globally but want certain routes to bypass it, there isn't a direct built-in mechanism in NestJS to "exclude" routes from a global guard. Instead, you can handle this in the guard itself by checking the route path or some metadata to decide whether the guard should be enforced.

For example, within the `AuthGuard`, you might check `request.route.path` to see if the path matches one of a few public routes. If it matches, you might choose to bypass the guard logic and allow the request.

```typescript
canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
  const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
  
  // Bypass the guard for specific routes
  if (['/public-route-1', '/public-route-2'].includes(request.route.path)) {
    return true;
  }

  // ... rest of the guard logic
}
```

This is a basic example, and in real-world applications, you might use route metadata or other more sophisticated mechanisms to decide on guard behavior.

Remember, while guards provide powerful tools for controlling access to routes, they should be used thoughtfully to ensure that the application's behavior is as expected.

## **Built-in Guards**:

### Using the `AuthGuard` with `@nestjs/passport`:

When integrating `passport` strategies into your NestJS application using `@nestjs/passport`, you can leverage the `AuthGuard` to easily implement and manage these strategies.

Here's a step-by-step guide on using the built-in `AuthGuard` with a `passport-local` strategy as an example:

#### 1. Install necessary packages:

```bash
npm install --save @nestjs/passport passport passport-local
npm install --save-dev @types/passport @types/passport-local
```

#### 2. Implement the Passport strategy:

Create a `local.strategy.ts` to define the local strategy.

```typescript
import { Injectable, UnauthorizedException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { PassportStrategy } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { Strategy } from 'passport-local';

@Injectable()
export class LocalStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  async validate(username: string, password: string): Promise<any> {
    // You'd typically fetch the user from your database here
    // For this example, let's use a dummy check.
    if (username === 'user' && password === 'password') {
      return { id: 1, username };
    } else {
      throw new UnauthorizedException();
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Set up the `AuthService` and `AuthGuard`:

Now that you've implemented the Passport strategy, you can utilize the built-in `AuthGuard` to apply it to your routes.

Create an `auth.service.ts`:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  // In a real-world scenario, this service would manage user authentication, JWTs, etc.
  validateUser(username: string, password: string): any {
    if (username === 'user' && password === 'password') {
      return { id: 1, username };
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

#### 4. Use the `AuthGuard` in your controller:

Now that everything is set up, you can use the `AuthGuard` in your controller to protect specific routes.

```typescript
import { Controller, Post, UseGuards, Request } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Controller('auth')
export class AuthController {
  
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('local'))
  @Post('login')
  login(@Request() req) {
    // For the sake of this example, just return the user info.
    return req.user;
  }
}
```

The `AuthGuard('local')` applies the `passport-local` strategy that you've defined earlier. If the strategy's `validate` method throws an exception, the guard will reject the request. If it successfully returns a user object, that user object will be attached to the `req.user` property.

There are also other built-in guards like `JwtAuthGuard` or other custom strategies that you can use with the `AuthGuard` when working with different authentication methods (JWT, OAuth2, etc.).

Remember, the primary advantage of using these built-in guards is that it abstracts away a lot of boilerplate code related to managing the authentication strategies, allowing you to focus on the business logic of your application.
